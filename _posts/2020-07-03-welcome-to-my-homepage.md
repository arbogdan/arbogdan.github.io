# Hey there!
If you're reading this, then in the infinitely vast space of the interwebs, you've managed to navigate your way to my little patch of space. I created this website as a side-project during the Great Coronavirus Pandemic of 2020 (copyright pending) for a number of reasons, namely:

* As repository for my side-project work & coding portfolio (which can be viewed in greater detail on my GitHub page)
* As a showcase for the work of my advisees from the Cluj School of Public Health in Cluj-Napoca, Romania
* As an organic version of a resume/CV
* As a medium for opinion pieces and some light blogging on random topics like applications for reinforcement learning in dynamic options pricing, or artisanal basket weaving

The website still needs a lot of work, and should definitely be regarded as a "work in progress" for the time being. I'm hopeful that I will be able to get everything up and running to a satisfactory degree within a few weeks. Thanks to the folks who helped me sift through themes for the layout, and for anyone who has taken the time to read this and other posts!

#### Most importantly, a HUGE thank you to Sujay Kundu, the architect behind this awesome theme!
