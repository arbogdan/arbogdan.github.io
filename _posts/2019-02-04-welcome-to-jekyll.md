This post is a modified version of the **Welcome to devlpor!** introduction page bundled into this theme by [Sujay Kundu](https://github.com/sujaykundu777). Using this content as a base, I will expand upon the exciting features that **Jekyll** offers to users and provide a brief walkthrough of the file directory structure that accompanies any website generated using this framework.  

# Jekyll: A lightweight framework for quickly creating static websites & blogs
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static site generator built using [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) with a focus on simplicity, customizability, and an emphasis on supporting blog-style websites. It is the framework that drives GitHub Pages (like the one you're currently reading this from!) and makes creating your own personal website a breeze. Jekyll is organized into seven (7) main components, each of which will be explained further below. All of this information can be found on the Jekyll documentation page in even greater detail.

# Under Construction - Check back soon!

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].

We’ve included everything you need to create engaging posts about your work, and show off your case studies in a beautiful way.

**Obviously,**we’ve styled up *all the basic* text formatting options available in [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

You can create lists:

* Simple bulleted lists
* Like this one
* Are cool

And:

1. Numbered lists
2. Like this other one
3. Are great too

You can also add **blockquotes**, which are shown at a larger width to help break up the layout and draw attention to key parts of your content:
